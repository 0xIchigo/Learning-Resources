# Ichigo's Comprehensive Developer Guide
The following is a comprehensive list of resources that I've gathered while learning how to code. It's important to remember that this isn't the definitive way to learn how to code - this is what worked for me. I've tried to incorporate a variety of different learning resources across various mediums, both paid and unpaid, that I've used to help get me where I am today!


## Before You Actually Write Any Code
Before actually writing any code, ask yourself why you want to learn to code. What interests you about coding? What areas within software development would you like to focus on? Do you want to write code that focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that users will interact with, or code that focuses on the server-side of development using databases, scripts, and designing software architecture? Or, would you enjoy doing both as a full-stack developer?

Then, I'd watch the following in order to start thinking like a developer:
- [The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U)
- [Problem-Solving for Developers - A Beginner's Guide](https://youtu.be/UFc-RPbq8kg)
- [Introduction to Programming and Computer Science](https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E)

Once you're comfortable thinking like a developer, it's time to get comfortable with an IDE (integrated development environment) - software that combines various developer tools into a single GUI used for building applications. My personal favorite is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as I like its IntelliSense (syntax highlighting and autocomplete) as well as its built in Git commands. It's highly customizable so I'd recommend using it.
