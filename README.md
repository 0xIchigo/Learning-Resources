# Ichigo's Comprehensive Developer Guide
The following is a comprehensive list of resources that I've gathered while learning how to code. It's important to remember that this isn't the definitive way to learn how to code - this is what worked for me. I've tried to incorporate a variety of different learning resources across various mediums, both paid and unpaid, that I've used to help get me where I am today!

## Before You Actually Write Any Code
Before actually writing any code, ask yourself why you want to learn to code. What interests you about coding? What areas within software development would you like to focus on? Do you want to write code that focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that users will interact with, or code that focuses on the server-side of development using databases, scripts, and designing software architecture? Or, would you enjoy doing both as a full-stack developer?

Then, I'd watch the following in order to start thinking like a developer:
- [The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U)
- [Problem-Solving for Developers - A Beginner's Guide](https://youtu.be/UFc-RPbq8kg)
- [Introduction to Programming and Computer Science](https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E)

If you're coming from a non-technical background, just like myself, or feel like you'd like to have a more general overview of computer science then it might be worthwhile to watch a few videos by [Crash Course](https://youtu.be/tpIctyqH29Q)

### IDEs/Text-editors
Once you're comfortable thinking like a developer, it's time to get comfortable with an IDE (integrated development environment) - software that combines various developer tools into a single GUI used for building applications. My personal favorite is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as I like its IntelliSense (for example, syntax highlighting and autocomplete), its built in Git commands, and it is highgly customizable so I'd recommend using it. It's important to be comfortable with your IDE so I'd recommend watching a video such as: [Visual Studio Code Crash Course](https://youtu.be/WPqXP_kLzpo)

There are many other IDEs as well as text-editors available for you to use such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Coda, which is now called Nova](https://nova.app/), [PyCharm for (Python development)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

### Mathematics
Math isn't essential for being a great developer - you can be a developer and suck at math. If, however, you wanted to go into game development, data science, or cryptography, for example, it wouldn't hurt to have a grasp on more intermediate areas of math such as linear algebra. Nine times out of ten, a complex mathematical proof can be reduced to importing a library that does the calculation for you or someone has already posted the code you're looking for on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

Learning some aspects of mathematics can help you be a better developer - developers need a strong sense of logic to write efficient and correct code, which mathematical reasoning can help with. Moreover, abstract models of data are used to solve problems (heaps, lists, sets, graphs, trees, maps, etc.) so looking into a little bit of graph theory can help in that aspect. However, you can find examples of these data structures and algorithms in almost any language via a simple Google search. So, it honestly depends what kind of programming you'd like to do but I will always urge new developers to at least look at introductory material:
- [Do You Need To Know Math To Be A Programmer?](https://youtu.be/40uBqG0yhJg)
- [Math for Programmers Tutorial - Full Course on Sets and Logic](https://youtu.be/2SpuBqvNjHI)
- [Crash Course in Combinatorics | DCC #1](https://youtu.be/ggNeQUe1Hj8)

There are more in-depth free resources to teach yourself mathematics such as reading Oscar Levin's [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction, 3rd edition](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) or trying out freeCodeCamp's Open Beta for [Interactive Math Coruses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-foundational-math-curriculum/) that'll teach you foundational mathematics

### Google is Your Best Friend
One of the most powerful and essential tools in your developer toolkit is Google - it's a software developer's best friend. It's hard to remember every single minor detail and nuance to every language and framework you use; that's what Google is for. I'm not advocating for you to visit Stack Overflow and copy the most upvoted answer for every problem you encounter. Instead, Google can be used to research possible solutions, which you, as a developer, can evaluate for its effectiveness and applicability to the problem you've encountered. I'd recommend watching these videos:
- [How to "Google It" like a Senior Software Engineer](https://youtu.be/cEBkvm0-rg0)
- [Google HACKING (use google search to HACK!)](https://youtu.be/hrVa_dhD-iA)
- [HakByte: How to find anything on the internet with Google Dorks](https://youtu.be/lESeJ3EViCo)

## Going the Course Focused Route
As a self-taught developer, you have a multitude of resources and options available for you to learn how to code and one of the routes you can choose is to follow through introductory coding courses. These have the benefit of structured and predictable learning, and it provides a nice degree of consistency from the beginning to the end. If you pick the wrong course, however, you might feel obligated to weather the storm and complete a sub-par or outdated course because of sunk costs, which can deterr you from wanting to take other courses in the future or feed into feelings pursuant to impostorism. Thus, it is important, if you are going to do a course, to pick the right course.

If you're looking for a complete education in computer science - a proper, well-grounded fundamental understanding of all computing disciplines - using only online materials then [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) is the way to go. This is the equivalent of an entire computer science degree. You do not have to take this course in order to learn how to code. 

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is an amazing resource for learning web development as their full stack curriculum is free and supported by a passionate open source community, which updates the various courses regularly. Through the Odin Project, you start off taking a foundational course that takes you through the basics of Git, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, JavaScript, as well as giving a quick overview of what goes on behind the scenes on a web server. From there, you have the choice of two learning paths: Full Stack Ruby on Rails, Full Stack JavaScript. Personally, as a developer in Web3 I'd recommend taking the JavaScript path as I use it regularly on both side projects and my full-time job. Plus, learning JavaScript arguably opens up more learning paths for you as you can then start to learn TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and Node.js shortly thereafter

I cannot recommend [freeCodeCamp's courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) enough! They offer free courses on everything from responsive web design to machine learning with Python. freeCodeCamp has also announced recently they're pushing their [Web3 Curricumulm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web3-curriculum-open-beta/) to open beta, as well as their [Solana Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solana-curriculum/) and [NEAR Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/near-curriculum/)

Albeit being a paid resource, for the start of my developer learning journey I went through the first half of Colt Steele's Udemy course [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) - I found it as a really useful guide for learning the fundamentals of web development that helped supplement the other resources I was using at the time giving me a comprehensive run through of core concepts
