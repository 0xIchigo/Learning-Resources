# Ichigo's Comprehensive Developer Guide
The following is a comprehensive list of resources that I've gathered while learning how to code. It's important to remember that this isn't the definitive way to learn how to code - this is what worked for me. I've tried to incorporate a variety of different learning resources across various mediums, both paid and unpaid, that I've used to help get me where I am today!


## Before You Actually Write Any Code
Before actually writing any code, ask yourself why you want to learn to code. What interests you about coding? What areas within software development would you like to focus on? Do you want to write code that focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that users will interact with, or code that focuses on the server-side of development using databases, scripts, and designing software architecture? Or, would you enjoy doing both as a full-stack developer?

Then, I'd watch the following in order to start thinking like a developer:
- [The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U)
- [Problem-Solving for Developers - A Beginner's Guide](https://youtu.be/UFc-RPbq8kg)
- [Introduction to Programming and Computer Science](https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E)

Once you're comfortable thinking like a developer, it's time to get comfortable with an IDE (integrated development environment) - software that combines various developer tools into a single GUI used for building applications. My personal favorite is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as I like its IntelliSense (for example, syntax highlighting and autocomplete), its built in Git commands, and it is highgly customizable so I'd recommend using it. It's important to be comfortable with your IDE so I'd recommend watching a video such as: [Visual Studio Code Crash Course](https://youtu.be/WPqXP_kLzpo)

Math isn't essential for being a great developer - you can be a developer and suck at math. If, however, you wanted to go into game development, data science, or cryptography, for example, it wouldn't hurt to have a grasp on more intermediate areas of math such as linear algebra. Nine times out of ten, a complex mathematical proof can be reduced to importing a library that does the calculation for you or someone has already posted the code you're looking for on Stack Overflow.

Learning some aspects of mathematics can help you be a better developer - developers need a strong sense of logic to write efficient and correct code, which mathematical reasoning can help with. Moreover, abstract models of data are used to solve problems (heaps, lists, sets, graphs, trees, maps, etc.) so looking into a little bit of graph theory can help in that aspect. However, you can find examples of these data structures and algorithms in almost any language via a simple Google search. So, it honestly depends what kind of programming you'd like to do but I will always urge new developers to at least look at introductory material:
- [Do You Need To Know Math To Be A Programmer?](https://youtu.be/40uBqG0yhJg)
- [Math for Programmers Tutorial - Full Course on Sets and Logic](https://youtu.be/2SpuBqvNjHI)
- [Crash Course in Combinatorics | DCC #1](https://youtu.be/ggNeQUe1Hj8)

There are more in-depth free resources to teach yourself mathematics such as Oscar Levin's [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction, 3rd edition](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html)

One of the most powerful and essential tools in your developer toolkit is Google - it's a software developer's best friend. It's hard to remember every single minor detail and nuance to every language and framework you use; that's what Google is for. I'm not advocating for you to visit Stack Overflow and copy the most upvoted answer for every problem you encounter. Instead, Google can be used to research possible solutions, which you, as a developer, can evaluate for its effectiveness and applicability to the problem you've encountered. I'd recommend watching these videos:
- [How to "Google It" like a Senior Software Engineer](https://youtu.be/cEBkvm0-rg0)
- [Google HACKING (use google search to HACK!)](https://youtu.be/hrVa_dhD-iA)
- [HakByte: How to find anything on the internet with Google Dorks](https://youtu.be/lESeJ3EViCo)
