# Ichigo's Comprehensive Developer Guide
The following is a comprehensive list of resources that I've gathered while learning how to code. It's important to remember that this isn't the definitive way to learn how to code - this is what worked for me. I've tried to incorporate a variety of different learning resources across various mediums, both paid and unpaid, that I've used to help get me where I am today!


## Before You Actually Write Any Code
Before actually writing any code, ask yourself why you want to learn to code. What interests you about coding? What areas within software development would you like to focus on? Do you want to write code that focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that users will interact with, or code that focuses on the server-side of development using databases, scripts, and designing software architecture? Or, would you enjoy doing both as a full-stack developer?

Then, I'd watch the following:
